# twitter_analysis_universities
## Problem Statement
Explore the tweets posted by any two international universities. Analyze the data in tweets and answer some common questions that international students applying to the university might have, like:
1. Which words are mostly used in the tweets?
2. Which hashtags does the university use mostly?
3. Which university is more active during summer?
Perform some analyzes that helps the university, like:
1. What day of the week do the shared tweets attract more attention?
2. What time of day do the shared tweets attract maximum likes?

## Problem Importance
This project helps the international students applying to universities gain more insight into what the university promotes, student life etc. It can further help them compare two universities based in same city.
This project can also be used by universities to improve and regulate their twitter posts depending upon the response statistics.

## Selecting Universities to Analyze
Being a student in Turku (Finland), the initial goal was to analyze two important universities based in Turku which are Ã…bo Akademi University and University of Turku. But since these universities are based in Finland, some of the posts were in Finnish or Swedish and analyzing hashtags and words was difficult due to my lack of knowledge in these languages.
Therefore, the universities chosen for analyses are two renowned universities based in United Kingdom namely, University of Oxford (@UniofOxford) and Cambridge University (@Cambridge_Uni). The following are primary reasons for choosing these universities:
1. They belong to English speaking regions; hence the tweets are guaranteed to be in English language.
2. They are highly popular among the youth, with thousands of followers, so analyzing statistics would be interesting.
